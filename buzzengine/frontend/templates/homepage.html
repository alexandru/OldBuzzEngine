    <h2>Open-source commenting system</h2>

    <p>
      TheBuzzEngine is open-source software that brings visitors
      comments to your webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
      Content websites do not necessarily need complicated software
      for publishing an article. You just need a <b>cheap</b> (or even
      free) web-hosting solution for your static HTML content.  <a
      href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> are all the
      rage amongst geeks these days.
    </p>

    <p>
      Except that you need user-interaction with your content,
      especially comments.
    </p>

    <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>

    <p>
      The software itself is free of charge and open-source. Hosting
      is provided by <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/"
      target="_blank">Google's App Engine</a> and is also free of
      charge for low-traffic websites (up to a quota). In practice the
      popularity of your website will have to be huge before shelling
      out a couple of bucks per month.
    </p>

    <h2>What about DISQUS or Facebook?</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	content isn't yours, and in the case of Facebook moderation
        of comments gets tricky
      </li>
      <li>
         these are companies providing a service which may be
         discontinued at some point. User comments are a valuable
         part of your website that may vanish
      </li>
      <li>
	Facebook isn't known for good ethics and DISQUS is too
	young. If you value your users, placing bets on companies who
	do not generate income directly from you is tricky and your
	faith must be strong ;)
      </li>
      <li>
        basically TheBuzzEngine is all about <b>control</b> and
        <b>simplicity</b>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technicalities</h2>

    <p>
      The application is built to run on top of Google App
      Engine. Scalability is theoretically unlimited and the usage
      simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      After setting up a Google App Engine account and deploying on
      it, all you need to do is copy/paste a Javascript widget in your
      web pages were you want comments.
    </p>

    <h2>I don't want to setup my own GAE account</h2>

    <p>
      I'm still thinking about making this app more end-user friendly
      by letting people use my own setup. If you're interested, send
      me an email.
    </p>
